初见是一齐我的主客。
　　离久方知感情深。一个经常在故土里打转的人是无从掂量自己对故土的感情分量的，这就如同一个经常在母亲身边的孩子找不到想念母亲的滋味一般。而一旦离开故土，时间长了，不论他乡是繁华与否，也不论在他乡过得好坏与否，总是会有想到故土和故土上的人和事的时候。阔别故土十余载的我，如今工作在这个纷扰的小城，工作之余，常常会关注生养我的故土，会时而不时地给家中的父母打电话了解故土的变化；会时而不时地地带上家小回到故土闻闻故乡的空气，见见故乡的亲人，晒晒故乡的阳光；也会把父母接来小城里小居一段时间，让经常蜗居故土的父母出外领略别样的风景，沐浴别样的阳光，呼吸别样的空气。尽管父母在城里比在故土里住得舒爽、吃得舒服、穿得舒心，但时间一长，父母就不自在甚至愁眉苦脸了。这不是儿子不孝、儿媳不敬、孙子不恭，是父母又开始思念故土和思念故土上生活的亲人了。于是，又只得把他们送回故土里，当他们一踏上故土的路，就又眉开眼笑了。原来，城里生活条件再好、生活水平再高，在故土里生活大半辈子的父母还是不会因为环境条件的改变而忘记故土的。相反，随着时间的推移，会更加牵挂起故土来。于此，我们也就不难理解亲民党主席宋楚瑜率团踏进祖国大陆时的言行举止。我们在电视屏幕中看到宋楚瑜在大陆访问期间，满眼潮湿，神情激动。当抵达阔别56年的家乡湖南长沙时，宋楚瑜一开口就操起浓厚的湘潭话说：“各位湖南的老乡们，楚瑜带着堂客回来喽！”当到湘潭县射埠镇巨鱼村祭祖完毕时，宋楚瑜还抓了两把故乡的土带走……
　　这都不要紧。就让百感交集吧，就让头顶上的天受点气吧。
A: as long as went to the old man will appreciate death, Lao tze came into the classroom, he immediately stop class give me move the sofa, thank you so much for coming, cigarette. Said a lot of guidance, better place...
She is?
My pain, of course, not just because of these.
I still remember the song song spread zhao-hui xu hair hanging down, remember when she pulls her hair with pretty forehead, remember the way she laughs at the title...
I miss her!
Those days, I always use a short rest at noon time ran county on the wharf.
Port is close to our school, out of the door, about two blocks, is the legacy of a large open swept s fuck dam, fuck is pier under the dam.
I sat in the shallow grass flat out on the quay, as long as the boat came and was staring at the those up and down the guest.
I wish I could find zhao-hui xu, but people are scattered, ship, port of empty, zhao-hui xu didn't appear.
By ships ChongDang up the river, a wave another wave JinMan beach grass, wet my legs, but I have no consciousness.
Looking at the wire into white clouds in the sky, I want to zhao-hui xu exactly where to go?
The beginning of her missing, someone says she cliff dead, but make not only cleared the principal Yang Houshan valley, still trying to identify the laojun mountain valley, the result even the zhao-hui xu did not find a piece of clothes.
Say she jump river, the river and didn't found the dead body.
Others said she may be eaten by wild animals in the mountain, it is almost impossible.
Though we there Alexander, can eat a person of beast, extinct, before we were born and even ferocious wild boar and tiger, also won't chew people clothes.
So where is zhao-hui xu?
